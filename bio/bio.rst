            I’m a research scientist in the area of computational geoscience, high performance computing, and numerical methods in Houston, TX.  Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I was a member of the <a href="http://math.mit.edu/icg/" target="_blank">Imaging and Computing Group</a> in the department of mathematics, where I worked with <a href="http://math.mit.edu/icg/people/laurent.html" target="_blank">Laurent Demanet</a>.&nbsp; My research at MIT was concerned with the numerical and computational aspects of the seismic tomography.  As part of my postdoc, I developed the <a href="http://www.pysit.org/">PySIT toolbox</a> for seismic inversion in Python.

            I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.cse.illinois.edu/scg/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, where my work on numerical methods for solar tomography from STEREO observations was advised by <a href="/web/20131010191828/http://www.cse.illinois.edu/~heath/">Michael Heath</a> and <a href="/web/20131010191828/http://www.ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile.asp?farzadk" target="_blank">Farzad Kamalabadi</a>.

            My thesis work is on the computational and numerical aspects of image formation and image processing.&nbsp; This work is primarily motivated by applications to solar physics and solar image processing, but I’m interested in problems that have applications all over science and engineering.&nbsp; You can find more information about my research to date under the research tab.&nbsp; I have always been interested in how techniques from areas more traditionally associated with computer science, such as machine learning, scientific visualization, computer vision and computational photography,&nbsp;graphics are applicable to problems in computational science.

            Prior to grad school, I earned a bachelors degree in computer science at <a href="/web/20131010191828/http://www.cs.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>, where I also minored in math and astronomy, worked for university tech support, and played recreational inline hockey.

            Outside of work you can find me doing any one of a number of things.&nbsp; If a game is on, I frequently spend an evening watching Washington Capitals hockey on TV with my wife Tara and our dog Ovie.&nbsp; On Saturdays I’ll set aside a few hours for the Virginia Tech football games.&nbsp; When they are on TV I’ll watch D.C. United soccer, or even better, get out to play pick up soccer. &nbsp;I enjoy cycling in the evenings, and am getting used to warm Houston winters after cold riding in Boston and Illinois.

            I’ve been known to play the occasional video game, though it is mostly old PC games.&nbsp; Tara and I also found that we love growing our own food in <a href="http://photos.russellhewett.com/Other/Garden-2010/12336716_sTh42z#881176230_5Gi3Q" target="_blank">our garden</a> (which is sadly on hiatus while we live in a swamp), picking and canning/jamming local berries, and cooking with the amazing foods we can get at our local market.&nbsp; I highly recommend <a href="http://photos.russellhewett.com/Other/Bacon/16678041_6M6Qwk#1257604687_2ZVs24f" target="_blank">curing your own bacon</a>&nbsp;and brewing your own beer.  I’ve recently taken up woodworking, primarily making frames for panoramic prints of my photography (see the Photos tab) and have gotten back into golf.

            When we get a chance to go on vacation, we love to go hiking and photographing in national parks.&nbsp; One day, we’d love try to visit every National Park and National Monument (and Forest, Seashore, Lakeshore, etc. of note) in the system.&nbsp; To date, we’ve visited the Pike NF (Pike’s Peak), Great Sand Dunes NP, Saguaro NP&nbsp; (East and West), Chiracahua NM, Coronado NF (Mt. Lemmon), Castillo de San Marcos NM, Cape Canaveral NS, Zion NP, Bryce Canyon NP, Dixie NF, Grand Staircase-Escalante NM, Capitol Reef NP, Organ Pipe Cactus NM, Rocky Mountain NP, the White Mountains NF, Shenandoah NP, Cape Cod NS, Yellowstone NP, Grand Teton NP, Fossil Butte NM, Minute Man NHP, Acadia NP, Ft. McHenry NM, Great Smokey Mountains NP, Redwood National and State Parks, Pinnacles NP, Point Reyes NS, Big Bend NP, Guadalupe Mountains NP, Carlsbad NP, Little Bighorn Battlefield NM, Glacier NP, White Sands NM, Arches NP, and Canyonlands NP.
